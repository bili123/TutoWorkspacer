TutoWorkspacer 0.1_alpha

Very simple tool for Windows to save and restore size and position of selected windows and starting the according software as well. TutoWorkspacer just creates AutoHotkey-scripts you can use as usual - and is an AutoHotkey-script itself. 

Warning: TutoWorkspacer is primarily made for my personal usage and an AutoHotkey post on our blog. State of today it's very very very (in fact, we need some more of those guys ..) alpha and I'm even not a developer ;) But it works and maybe someone finds it useful. Or at least a line or so.

Prerequisites: Install AutoHotkey.

Really missing/to be done: Error handling, cancel button, help, producing less redundant script code, testing on other systems.

Usage:
1. Place windows as you like.
2. Start TutoWorkspacer.
3. Type a name for your script, e.g. "MyWorkspace".
4. Click on "Fenster hinzufÃ¼gen" (-> add window - yes, german, because it's for a german blog ...)
5. Click on window - you'll get a response in the GUI and a message window.
6. Add more windows.
7. Click on "Fertigstelle" (finish) - GUI will be reset.
8. You'll find the file "MyWorkspace.ahk" in the TutoWorkspacer-directory.

We have a post about TutoWorkspacer on our blog [well, we will have, github first - link follows].
